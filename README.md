# Picking

Pickin' with Banjo and Guitar!

This app is being designed for TV, desktops, browsers, tablets and phones. The goal is to create a
guided experience for learning how to play bluegrass music.

## UX on Figma

UX is designed in Figma and is [viewable here](https://www.figma.com/file/VT6IaSweNLzZyIRC0KAU9M/Picking?node-id=3%3A20&t=0etglDvnJjKs4FHV-1).

## Flutter development

Flutter development is super simple! These commands install dependencies from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) and run the app:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This repository only has `macos` and `android` for development platforms. `flutter create` will create runnable projects for `web`, `ios`, `linux` and `windows` if necessary:

```bash
flutter create --platforms ios --org eighty4 --project-name picking .
```

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
